## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned
I learnt how to make my javaScript code dry, i.e less redundant.
Most developers have written this javaScript code in up to 250+ lines, but I have written mine in less than 50 lines. 
This might not be the perfect way but it is something I am proud of as a beginner.
Check my js file.


For my CSS, I will definitely have to go back and learn better!!!
For the entire challenge, I have a part I am not satisfied with and I would love to work on later. i.e whenever i try to open my modal for mobile, the body shakes and does not look good to me. I will work on this but if you have an idea on how i can fix this, I am open.
